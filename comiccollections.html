                    <h3>The Creator Of Star Wars</h3>
                    <p>
                        George Lucas, a Canadian artist, writer, and publisher, created the comic books for the film. 
                        He started the Marvel Comics universe in 1977 with the publication of his six-issue comic adaptation of the film. 
                        He later expanded the Marvel universe to include DC Comics in 1984. 
                        George Lucas also created the DC Universe in 1986, which included the publication of his seven-issue comic adaptation of the film. 
                        He continued to create comic books for the Star Wars franchise through 2021. 

                        George Lucas soon planned a new space fantasy. Star Wars: A New Hope(1977), requiring him to create a visual effects company, 
                        industrial Light & Magic, and hire Ben Burtt as a sound designer (later evolving into Skywalker sound), to help bring his vision to the screen. 
                        Dreams are extremely important.
